# problem #221

# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Zillow.

# Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of 7,
# or the sum of unique powers of 7.
# The first few sevenish numbers are 1, 7, 8, 49, and so on.
# Create an algorithm to find the nth sevenish number.
import math
numb = 49
def sevenish_number(number):

    if math.sqrt(number) % number :
        print("is a power of 7 :",math.sqrt(number))

    if :
        
    
    else : 
        print("this number is not a power of 7 :", number)
    return 

sevenish_number(numb)
