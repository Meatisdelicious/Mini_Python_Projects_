# w5 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

# Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
# substring
#  without repeating characters.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
